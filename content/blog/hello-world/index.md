- Hello world! I am Sanjana Maheshwari. A Computer Engineering Sophormore at Zakir Husain College of Engineering and technology.
- I aspire to become an impactful Software Engineer. I like to try new stuff and see what comes out of them. For instance - This blogsite is my second attempt. I chose some wrong tech stack and super colourful css xD. I messed the first very nicely. It was great lesson to me. 
- I write a lot of code and like learning new algorithms.It gives me a confidence to tackle problems quickly and think efficiently.
- I recently became quite interested in cryptography and making some super begginer projects in same.I will try to write about them here.
- My hobbies include knowing about different cultures and people. I am working with a non-profit organisation that aims at imparting education to underprivileged children(This is story for another blog!).
- That's a wrap! The list will elongate in coming years. Bear with me xD.
