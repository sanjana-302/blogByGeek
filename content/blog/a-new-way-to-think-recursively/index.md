Recursion can be quite intimidating to understand when you doing it for the very first time. Sometimes it may happen that getting a
valid logic behind the code you write may seem magical and you start thinking "It's working let's not touch it."

Wierdly, this is my favourite topic. I found it intimidating at first but now I think recursion is the best way to right some clean and undestandable approach. I have mentioned an approach here that I use very often to solve problems recursively. Recursion uses inbuilt stack.

Some amigas may argue that making a recursion tree is best way to understand recursion problems. I am quite not in favor. A working recursive code is required to make a recursion tree and writing this code for a begginer might be cubersome. It becomes an 
infinite loop trying to undertand recursion, writing code and making diagrams of function returns.I have seen some of my friends 
struggling really hard graping these topics. The time when they come on topics like trees or advanced data structures that uses recursion at core , they get confused.


Let's dive straight to the topic - How to approach them in efficient manner?


You can try following these steps - 
1. Apply base case.
2. Do small work.
3. Ask recursion to give you remanining results.(And believe me when you are doing this assume recursion is giving you correct results.)

Steps 2 and 3 can be swapped.

Principle of mathematical Induction is the key here.


Let's take some examples for better understanding -
