I am Sanjana Maheshwari. A Computer Engineering Sophomore at Zakir Husain College of Engineering and technology.</li>\n<li>I aspire to become an excellent Software Engineer. I like to try new stuff and see what comes out of them. For instance - This blog site is my second attempt. I chose some wrong tech stack and super colorful CSS xD. I messed it. It was a great lesson for me. </li>\n<li>I write a lot of code and love learning new algorithms. It gives me the confidence to tackle problems quickly and think efficiently.</li>\n<li>I recently became quite interested in cryptography and making some super beginner projects in same. I will try to write about them here.</li>\n<li>My hobbies include knowing about different cultures and people. I am working with a non-profit organization that aims at imparting education to underprivileged children(This is a story for another blog!).</li>\n<li>That’s a wrap! The list will elongate in the coming years. Bear with me xD.</li>\n<li>Thank you!</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"About Myself!","date":"June 15, 2020","description":"Hello World!"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/hello-world/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/first-pull-request/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Merrier Days of May - My first pull request"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1246554614","2841359383"]}
