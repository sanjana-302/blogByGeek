I am Sanjana Maheshwari. A Computer Engineering Sophormore at Zakir Husain College of Engineering and technology.</li>\n<li>I aspire to become an impactful Software Engineer. I like to try new stuff and see what comes out of them. For instance - This blogsite is my second attempt. I chose some wrong tech stack and super colourful css xD. I messed the first very nicely. It was great lesson to me. </li>\n<li>I write a lot of code and like learning new algorithms.It gives me a confidence to tackle problems quickly and think efficiently.</li>\n<li>I recently became quite interested in cryptography and making some super begginer projects in same.I will try to write about them here.</li>\n<li>My hobbies include knowing about different cultures and people. I am working with a non-profit organisation that aims at imparting education to underprivileged children(This is story for another blog!).</li>\n<li>That’s a wrap! The list will elongate in coming years. Bear with me xD.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"About Myself!","date":"July 27, 2020","description":"Hello World!"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/hello-world/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/a-new-way-to-think-recursively/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How do you analyse Recursion?"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/data-security-analysis/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"I analysed Google security!"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1246554614","2841359383"]}
